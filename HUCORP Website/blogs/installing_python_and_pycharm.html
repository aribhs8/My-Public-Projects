            <h1>Installing Python and PyCharm</h1>
            <h2>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</h2>
            <p>In order for a computer to understand a programming language, the language must be translated
                to something the computer can understand. The way this information is translated is through
                the use of something known as a compiler. An Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, for short
                uses the language's compiler to run code directly from a text-editor. An IDE is not essential for
                programming, but it makes everything easier. As you journey into bigger and bigger projects, you
                want to make sure that you have a clean and efficient IDE that can keep up with the demands of your
                projects. When installing Python from the Python.org website, the installer will include an IDE known
                as "IDLE". "IDLE" is a decent IDE that will do the job for most projects. However, when you're projects
                become larger and utilize more advanced modules, it can seem painful to use "IDLE". For this reason, we
                have also included a section on installing PyCharm, a high-level, professional IDE as part of our
                tutorial.
            </p>
            <h2>Installing Python</h2>
            <h3>Windows 10 and MacOS</h3>
            <p>You can watch a video version of the tutorial here: </p>

            <h4>Checking Your Version of Windows</h4>
            <p>To install Python on Windows 10, you must first verify whether you are running a 32-bit
                or 64-bit version of Windows.
            </p>
            <p>To do this, navigate to the search bar and type "About". An option should appear saying
                "About Your PC". Click this option. On the settings screen that follows scroll down
                until you see the "System Type" heading. On the right of this heading, your version of
                Windows will be listed as a 64-bit operating system, or a 32-bit operating system.
            </p>
            <h4>Checking your version of MacOS</h4>
            <p>To install Python on MacOS, you must first verify whether you are running a 32-bit
                or 64-bit version of MacOS.
            </p>
            <p>To do this, go to the apple menu and choose "About This Mac". Below the operating system version
                and computer model name you'll see your processor. If the processor is and Intel Core Solo or
                Intel Core Duo, it's 32-bit only. Otherwise, your Mac is 64-bit.
            </p>
            <img src="images/mac-about-window.jpg" style="width: 70%; height: auto;" />
            <p>To install the python programming language, open your preferred web-browser and 
                navigate to "Python.org". Once you land on their home page, you should see either a navigation
                bar with the word "Downloads" at the top of the website, or a small button that says "Menu".
            </p>
            <h4>Navigation Bar Shown (Applicable to Microsoft Edge and IE)</h4>
            <p>If the navigation bar is visible, hover over the "Downloads" button and click on the dropdown-item
                that says "Windows", if you are using a Windows computer, or "Mac OS X" if your are using "MacOS". When you are 
                redirected to the Downloads page, scroll down to the stable releases section. Install the latest stable release 
                for your version of the operating system(x86 for 32-bit, and x86-64 for 64-bit) using the executable installer (.exe). 
                After it has downloaded, run the file.
            </p>
            <h4>Menu Button Shown (If No Navigation Bar with "Downloads")</h4>
            <p>If the menu button is visible, click the button. A navigation pane should open on the left side. On this
                navigation pane, click Downloads. You should be redirected to a page with the title "Download the latest version of Python"
                Underneath this text, you should see a yellow "Download Python" button. Click this button. You will be redirected
                to another page. This time, scroll all the way down to the "Files section" of the page. Once here, you should see
                a variety of installation files. Download the executable installer for your operating system version
                (x86 for 32-bit nad x86-64 for 64-bit) by clicking on the text. After it has downloaded, run the file.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>A window should now appear with the words "Install Python". At the bottom of this window, you should see two check-boxes.
                Make sure both check-boxes, "Install Python for all Users" and "Add Python to Path", are selected. You may now proceed 
                to installing Python by clicking "Next". 
            </p>
            <p>Once all the files have successfully been installed, you can exit out of the installer by pressing "Finish". To verify
                that the installation was successful, open the Windows Command Prompt by clicking the Windows search bar and typing "run".
                Once the Command Prompt opens, type "python --version" into the Command Prompt. The Command-Prompt should output the version
                of Python that you just installed.
            </p>

            <h2>Installing PyCharm</h2>
            <p>To install PyCharm, open your preferred web-browser and navigate to "https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/". 
                In the middle of the screen you should see a "DOWNLOAD NOW" button. Click this button. You will be redirected
                to a new screen with options to install for Windows, macOS or Linux.
            </p>

            <h3>Windows 10</h3>
            <p>To install PyCharm on Windows 10, make sure the "Windows" option is selected. You should see
                the option to download a professional or community edition. Choose the one that suits your interests
                and click "Download". After the file has finished downloading, run the file.
            </p>

            <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
            <p>To install PyCharm on Mac OS X, make sure the "Mac OS X" option is selected. You should see
                the option to download a professional or community edition. Choose the one that suits your interests
                and click "Download". After the file has finished downloading, run the file.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>A window should now appear with the words "Welcome to PyCharm Community Edition Setup". Click
                "Next". Specify a destination folder for the program to be installed. It is ok to leave it at 
                the default folder. Click "Next" again. More customization options will appear as you continue to 
                click "Next". Choose whatever options you find appropriate until you reach the end of the installation. 
                Once the installation has finished, you may click "Finish". PyCharm is now installed on your computer.</p>
