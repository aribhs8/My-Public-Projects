            <h1>Pygame Tutorial 1-2: Modifying the Pygame Template and Introducing Our Project</h1>
            <p>This is the first lesson of our tutorial series on programming games with Pygame. In this lesson we
                will modify the pygame template that we created in the first lesson for a cleaner outlook. The game that
                we will create with Pygame will also be introduced. These tutorials are intended for
                users who are completely new to the Pygame library and are looking for a quick and easy way to
                get started. Intermediate Python skills are required.</p>
            <p>A video version of this tutorial can be seen here: </p>

            <h2>Modifying the Pygame Template</h2>
            <p>In the last lesson, we covered the basics of pygame by creating a skeleton for any pygame project. The
                problem with this model, however, is that it can lead to incredibly messy code once your project begins to
                get more complex. To improve organization within our code, we can use a feature in python known as <em>modules</em>. Modules
                are a way to store pieces of Python code in different files to improve readability.This means that we can create 
                multiple files for one game, with each file fulfilling it's own unique purpose.</p>
            <p>To begin creating our new pygame template, we will need to create three files. We'll name the first
                file "main.py", the second file "settings.py" and the third file "sprites.py" (we may change the
                third file later - once things get even more messy!). Bear in mind that the items within the quotes represent the file name.</p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/files.png" />
            <p>We will start by working on the main file first. It is in this file where most of the game's elements will be
                located (the game loop, input processing, drawing/rendering and updating). To begin we will first import  the
                pygame and random libraries (as we did last time). For the sake of simplicity, we will make it so that we can access
                pygame by typing pg, rather than typing "pygame" all of the time. To do this we will type "import pygame as pg". After importing
                the random libraries, we will utilize our modules through the following syntax: "from (file name) import *". Your "main.py" file
                should now look like this:</p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/imports.png" />
            <p>After importing, we can begin re-creating our pygame template. The first thing that we will do is create a class labelled "Main"
                (illustrates that this is the class responsible for our game), and we will create a constructor for this class through the use
                of the __init__() method. Inside the constructor, we will initialize pygame, the pygame mixer and our game window.</p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/class_declaration.png" />
            <p>But wait! We haven't yet defined WIDTH, HEIGHT and TITLE. This is where our modules come in handy. WIDTH, HEIGHT and TITLE are settings
                for the game window, which means that it makes since to store their values their. We will define WIDTH, HEIGHT and TITLE in our
                "settings.py" file:</p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/screen_settings.png" />
            <p>While we are defining our screen settings in the "settings.py" file, we may as well define our colors as
                well:</p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/settings.png" />
            <p>For our purposes (creating a new pygame template), this should be all the code we need in our "settings.py". Let's head back to our
                "main.py" file and begin creating our game. Inside our "Main" class, we will have 7 methods (excluding the constructor). The
                first method will be "new()", in which we will create a new game. In the "new()" method we will create a "sprite group" that we
                will later use to show our sprites onto the screen. To do this we will type "self.all_sprites = pg.sprite.Group()" inside the new
                method. While we're at it, we'll create run(), update(), events() and draw() methods. In the "new()" method we will also call the
                run() method.</p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/main_methods.png" />
            <p>In our "run()" method, we will create a "self.playing" variable to create a game loop, in which we will call the update(), events() and draw()
                methods. We will also set the FPS of our game within the loop. The order of the methods does not matter, except for the draw method (which should
                be last because of <em>pg.display.flip()</em>).</p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/run_method.png" />
            <p>Now we will fill in the remaining methods with the remaining code that we used in our original template. We will also
                utilize the "all_sprites" group that we created for updating and drawing:</p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/main_methods_complete.png" />
            <p>Below our "Main" class, we need to create an instance of this class to make our game work. To do this we'll create
                another method called game(). We'll call this method if we are running the "main.py" file and it will create an instance
                of our "Main" class called "g":</p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/class_instance.png" />
            <p>Since we want our game to look as professional as possible, we will also include a start screen and a game over screen.
                However, since this is just a template, we will only create empty methods for these two elements. That way, when we're ready
                to work on our start and game over screens, we won't have to refactor as much code:</p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/start_screen.png" />
            <p>After creating these two methods, we can finish our "game" method. We will add the following code:</p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/finished_game_method.png" />
            <p>Finally, after correcting all of those annoying pyLint errors that kept popping up (the wildcard (*) was removed as it's use
                is discouraged), we get this: </p>
            <img src="../images/blogs/pygame_tutorials/1-2/finished_template.png" />
            <br><br><br>
            <p>The code can be found on Github here: </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Our Project - Justice League</h2>
            <p>For our tutorial series, we will focus on creating a game based on DC's most popular characters, the Justice League!
                For the sake of simplicity, we will only use 4 leaguers, with each possessing their own unique ability for use in the game.
                We will use Flash for his incredible speed, Green Lantern for his ability to move heavy objects with his ring, Batman, because
                he's Batman, and Aquaman, for his underwater capabilities. The game will be based on the online flash platformer game "Tag Team Titans".
                The reason we decided to use this game as a benchmark is because it will allow our game to utilize several of pygame's complex features. 
                We'll work with gravity, forces, collisions, power-ups, different character-abilities, and multiple levels!</p>
            <p>A demo of "Tag Team Titans" can be seen below (all credits go to Lagged): </p>
