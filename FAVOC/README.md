This is a project that I created for Computer Engineering class. Included is a circuit diagram that was created through the use Fritzing, CAD drawings done through SolidWorks 2018, code that was created for the Raspberry Pi using Python, and a website that was created through HTML, CSS and Javascript as a means of marketing the product.
