# AutoHeater
This folder contains information about my autoheater project. The objective was to create a smart thermostat that could turn a portable space heater on/off depending on the desired temperature settings. This project incorporated CAD with SolidWorks, circuit design with Altium designer and code through embedded-C using Atmel Studio.
